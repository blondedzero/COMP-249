What we need to do for:

- CellPhone:
* attributes
* constructors
* clone method
* toString, equals, getters & setters

- CellList:
* private inner class CellNode (see next section)
* private attributes: 
    1. head (points to first node in list)
    2. size (# of nodes in list)
* constructors
* addToStart method
* insertAtIndex method
* deleteFromIndex method
* deleteFromStart method
* replaceAtIndex method
* find method
* contains method
* showContents method
* equals method

- CellNode:
* object of CellPhone
* pointer to a CellNode
* constructors
* clone method
* gettes & setters

- CellListUtilization:
* has main method
* create 2+ empty CellList instances
* open Cell_Info.txt & read it line by line to initialize a CellList
* show contents of newly created list
* prompt user to enter some serial numbers
* search the list for these values
* create enough bojects to test each constructor/method
